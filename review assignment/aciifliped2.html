                The Royal Ontario Museum (ROM; French: Musée royal de l'Ontario) is a museum of art, world culture and natural <br>
                history in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is one of the largest museums in North America and the largest in <br>
                Canada. It attracts more than one million visitors every year, making the ROM the most-visited museum <br>
                in Canada.[2] The museum is north of Queen's Park, in the University of Toronto district, with its <br>
                main entrance on Bloor Street West. Museum subway station is named after the ROM and, since a 2008 <br>

                Iroquois Ridge High School has three stories, each of which are dedicated to a particular academic field. <br>
                The first floor is dedicated to courses relating to business studies, the arts, technologies, <br>
                and physical education. The second floor is devoted almost entirely to modern languages, social studies, <br>
                and computer sciences, and is also home to the library and three computer labs. The third floor holds mathematics <br>
                classrooms and science labs. The school's main hallway is a large atrium which extends up all three stories, <br>
                and has a large skylight which covers the entire ceiling. It is nicknamed "The Street" because of its <br>
                planted trees, old-fashioned street lights, and the fact that the classroom windows on either side make it <br>
                seem as though one is walking between two buildings.
